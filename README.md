# Your Project's Name
SG Food Hour

This website(assignment) is to help ngee ann staff and student to be able to order things online.
Now we have both makan place and food club stores and user can earn points when they purchase things using 
sg food hour and can exchange for rewards.
 
## Design Process
 
 This website is fo people we work or study in ngee ann poly. some time we think the ngee ann canteens have a very long queue or people are rushing for lesson so is hard or limited time for them to go to queue and buy food.
 So if they can order things online this can make they life more easier ask they can order online first and when they they travel to stores the food is ready for them they can just eat and enjoy without eating.
